AI-Based Student Profiling & Career Recommendation System
An intelligent machine learning–based system that analyzes a student’s academic performance, technical skills, interests, and experience to provide personalized career recommendations through an **interactive Streamlit web application**.
 📌 Problem Statement

Students often struggle to choose the right career path due to lack of personalized guidance, awareness of their strengths, and understanding of industry requirements. Traditional career counseling methods are generic and do not adapt to individual student profiles.
 Proposed Solution

This project proposes an AI-driven career guidance system that uses machine learning models to profile students and recommend suitable career paths based on multiple parameters such as CGPA, skills, interests, and project experience.
The system follows a two-stage prediction approach and provides explainable, interactive, and user-friendly recommendations.
